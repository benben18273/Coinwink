            </p>
            <p>
            Below, the main three Coinwink features are explained in detail.
            </p>
            <h2>Crypto Alerts</h2>
            <p>Coinwink started as a crypto alerting service, and this is what it does best.</p>
            <p>When you create a Coinwink crypto alert, you can safely forget charts because Coinwink is now watching the price for you.</p>
            <p>The two delivery methods, <a href="https://coinwink.com/blog/never-miss-important-coin-price-changes-with-email-sms-crypto-alerts" target="_blank" class="blacklink">SMS and email</a>, is the universal, timeless and customizable combination that works for all possible scenarios.</p>
            <p>Coinwink is not relying on mobile notifications since they are inherently annoying, easy to miss and may negatively impact productivity.</p>
            <p>Coinwink crypto alerts are reliable, precise and fast.</p>
            <h3>Crypto Portfolio</h3>
            <p>Coinwink Portfolio allows you to keep track of your crypto holdings in a single structured dashboard.</p>
            <p>You can convert between different currencies, calculate return on investment (ROI), make notes for individual coins, and get new insights into the overall situation of your portfolio.</p>
            <p>Additionally, the portfolio has a multiple-coin crypto alerts feature. You only need to set multiple-coin alerts once. After that, there is no more need to keep checking the portfolio until any coin in the portfolio passes the threshold, and the alert is received.
            </p>
            <h3>Crypto Watchlist</h3>
            <p>
            Coinwink Watchlist is a recently released feature. Its UI is consistent with the portfolio, which makes both tools easy to use.
            </p>
            <p>
            Apart from navigational similarities, the watchlist serves a completely different function than the portfolio. Watchlist is for the opportunity hunt. Also, it's a way to get out of a “filter bubble”.
            </p>
            <h3>Tips &amp; Tricks</h3>
            <p>
            You can place the Coinwink app icon on your mobile device home screen. To do this, open coinwink.com in your mobile Chrome browser, click settings and then Add to Home Screen. You will then be able to use Coinwink similarly as a mobile app. See a how-to <a href="https://twitter.com/Coinwink/status/1164883857419788289" class="blacklink" target="_blank">video</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
            Use (and bookmark) a custom url address to pre-select your coin. Put the coin symbol after the slash, e.g. <a href="https://coinwink.com/eth" class="blacklink" target="_blank">https://coinwink.com/eth</a>
            </p>
            <p>
            Click on any coin's logo, anywhere in the Coinwink app, to open that coin's CoinMarketCap page, where you will find additional data: charts, social news, stats, and other details about that coin.

            <h3>Philosophy</h3>
            <p>Coinwink is designed around the philosophy described in the book Trading in the Zone, written by Mark Douglas.</p>
            <p>It states that trading is successful when it's done from the carefree, winning mindset, which is based not on extensive analysis, but on cultivated intuition.</p>
            <p>After all, it only takes one wink!</p>
            <p>Additionally, Coinwink is designed according to the Pareto principle. That's why only the most important information (20%) is presented while trying to avoid the less important (80%), which is often distractive and overwhelming.</p>
            <p>Coinwink also employs the "permanent beta" philosophy, which allows us to always learn and continuously improve.</p>
            <p>Let us know if you have ideas on how Coinwink can serve you better. Your feedback is welcome!</p>
